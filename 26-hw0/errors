- A train number of “worcesterTR=1314”
- There’s a “dir=I” and a “dir=I”
- Four options for days: m-f, sa (Saturday), su (Sunday), and “s”
- There’s a few time errors:
    - Most are “TI=“, but there’s a “T=17:09” row
    - A row with “TI=08:511”
    - A row with “TI=17” (instead of, presumably, 17:00)
    - “TI=19:2”
    - “TI=:24”
    - “TI=99:13”
    - I’m guessing times with 24:00 and above (up to 25:51) implies 1:15am the following morning, but on the “day” schedule
- Several errors in the station column:
    - A listing with just “48”
    - A line entry of “Line=greenbush”
    - A duplicate entry of “sttn=brandeis/ roberts”
- Two stations are included in the “line” column: “stn=fairmount” and “stn=jfk/umass”
- There is one entry with a 7th column, with “Line=fairmount”
